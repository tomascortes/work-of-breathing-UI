# work-of-breathing-UI
Software for obtaining PTP (Pressure-time product, a measure of breathing effort) values from respiratory data. Specifically, from Pes (esophageal pressure) and EAdi (electrical activity of the diaphragm) data obtained from patients with mechanical ventilatory assistance. Includes a user interface, displaying input signals and estimation of points of interest (start and end of inspiration).
 
# PTP estimation
The starting points for computing the Pes integral are computed by first finding the inflection points of the curve. The inflection points are estimated as the intersection points of two smoothed versions of the original curve (using a gaussian filter with two different user-inputted sigma values). Then the starting points are obtained as the first local peak before each inflection point. 
 
The ending points of the Pes integral are computed as the points in which each Edi cycle reaches 75% of its amplitude after the cycle's peak. The starting points of each Edi cycle are estimated in the same way as the Pes's starting points.
 
The PTP for each inspiration cycle is finally computed as the area over the Pes curve from each Pes's starting point to the next ending point.

# Usage
### Input
Input data must consist of an excel file with a worksheet with the name: **Resumen para anÃ¡lisis**, in which the two first columns contain the synchronized (same length) EAdi and Pes data, in that order. Data values are read starting from the second row.
### Interface usage
After executing main.py, the user interface will pop up. Choose the input file with *Abrir archivo* button and then press *Continuar*. If everything worked right you should see both signals (Edi and Pes) shown in interactive graphs.
 
You can now press _Calcular_ to compute and visualize the points of interest based on the smoothing values *Suavizado pequeÃ±o* and *Suavizado grande* (values shown at the right of input text boxes are the default values. You can also visualize the smoothed curves used in inflection point estimation by checking off the *Mostrar curva de suavizado* checkbox).
### Output
You can use de *Exportar datos* button to generate output. The output consists of an excel file located at _/calculated_data_ folder, which will be automatically created in the same location as the executable file. The output file can be identified by the input file's name and a timestamp corresponding to it's time of creation. This excel file contains a worksheet with the name "results'', in which there are 10 columns:
* _n_cycle_: Inspiration cycle identifier. The same number is shown in the interactive graphs.
* _integral_value_pes_: PTP value estimated for that inspiration cycle.
* _start_pes_: Datapoint used as starting point when computing the Pes integral (Where datapoint 0 corresponds to the first datapoint of the input signals, datapoint 1 corresponds to the second, and so forth).
* _start_edi_: Datapoint considered the starting point for the Edi cycle.
* _point_75%_: Datapoint used as ending point when computing the Pes integral.
* _t_start_pes->75%_: Time elapsed from _start_pes_ to _point_75%_ (All time output is under the assumption that the signal frequency is 100 data points per second).
* _t_start_pes-> start_edi_: Time elapsed from _start_pes_ to _start_edi_.
* _t_start_edi -> 75%_: Time elapsed from _start_edi_ to _point_75%_.
* _start_edi -> peak_edi_:
* _start_edi -> end_edi_:
